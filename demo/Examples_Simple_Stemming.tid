Here's the results looking for `jumps`:

<<list-links filter:"[!is[current]!is[system]ftsearch[jumps]]">>

Note how [[The quick fox jumped over the lazy dog]] is in the search results, even though "jumps" is itself not present - this is because the FTS plugin uses a process known as //stemming// to reduce both "jumped" and "jumps" to a root form.
