Full-text search plugin.  Provides functionality like
stemming and stop word removal, provided by lunr.js.

In order to make use of full-text search, you need to
build the index.  There's a tab in the control panel
with a button to do this; the index will last over
the course of your whole session.

# Ideas for Future Enhancement

  * Persist the index across sessions using local storage or similar.
  * Specify a filter for tiddlers to be included in the index.
